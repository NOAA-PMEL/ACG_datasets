*GLOBAL*,comment,"Organic Carbon (Sunset Laboratory thermal/optical analyzer)\nSub-1.1 um and sub-10 um samples were collected on pre-combusted quartz fiber filters using 2 and 1 stage impactors, respectively, for organic carbon (OC) and elemental carbon (EC) analysis [Bates et al., 2004]. A charcoal diffusion denuder was deployed upstream of the submicrometer impactor to remove gas phase organic species. OC and EC concentrations were determined with a Sunset Laboratory thermal/optical analyzer. Three temperature steps were used to evolve OC under O2-free conditions for quantification. The first step heated the filter to 230 Deg C; the second step heated the filter to 600 Deg C (AMS vaporizer temperature); and the final step heated the filter to 870 Deg C. After cooling the sample down to 550 Deg C, a He/O2 mixture was introduced and the sample was heated in four temperature steps to 910 Deg C to drive off EC. The transmission of light through the filter was measured to correct the observed EC for any OC that charred during the initial stages of heating. No correction was made for carbonate carbon so OC includes both organic and carbonate carbon. The percentage of carbonate carbon is unknown. Super-micrometer OC concentrations were determined by difference between submicrometer and sub-10 um impactor samples without denuders."
