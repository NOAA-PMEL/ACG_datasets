*GLOBAL*,comment,"Ion Chemistry Data (Ion Chromatograph):\nTwo and seven-stage multi-jet cascade impactors (Berner et al., 1979) sampling air at 55-60% RH were used to determine the mass size distribution of Cl-, NO3-, SO4=, Na+, NH4+, K+, Mg+2, and Ca+2. Sampling periods ranged from 12 to 24 hours. The RH of the sampled air stream was measured a few inches upstream from the impactors. The 2-stage impactors cut the samples into submicrometer (Daero < 1.1 um at 60% RH), and supermicrometer (1.1 um < Daero < 10 um) samples. Aerosol mass size distributions from the 7-stage impactors (size cuts at: 0.18, 0.31, 0.55, 1.1, 2.0, 4.1 and 10 um) are available for download at: http://saga.pmel.noaa.gov/data/chemdist.php?cruise=ATOMIC.\n\nThe impaction stage at the inlet of the impactor was coated with silicone grease to prevent the bounce of larger particles onto the downstream stages. Tedlar films were used as the collection substrate in the impaction stage and a Millipore Fluoropore filter (1.0-um pore size) was used for the backup filter. Films were cleaned in an ultrasonic bath in 10% H2O2 for 30 min, rinsed in distilled, deionized water, and dried in an NH3- and SO2-free glove box. Filters and films were wetted with 1 ml of spectral grade methanol and additional 5 ml of distilled deionized water were added to the solution and the substrates were extracted by sonicated for 30 min. For the 7 stage impactor (sizes 0.18, 0.31, 0.55 and 1.1), the extraction volume was reduced to 0.5mL:2.5mL methanol:water in later samples (12 and 15 through 27) to increase detection. The extracts were analyzed by ion chromatography [Quinn et al., 2000]. All handling of the substrates was done in the glove box. Blank levels were determined by loading an impactor with substrates but not drawing any air through it.\n\nConcentrations are reported as ug/m3 at STP (25C and 1 atm). Values below the detection limit are denoted with a zero and missing data are denoted with a NaN.\n\nBerner et al., Sci. Total Environ., 13, 245 - 261, 1979.\nQuinn et al., J. Geophys. Res., 105, 6785 - 6805, 2000."
